# AreIn - PHP Project MVC

Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage, AngularJS powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

  - Type some Markdown on the left
  - See HTML in the right
  - Magic

# Sobre o projeto

  - Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
  - Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)


You can also:
  - Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
  - Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML to Markdown converter
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Instalação

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
USE AREIN;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS working_hours, users;
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT(6) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, 
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE,
    is_admin BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false
);
CREATE TABLE working_hours (
    id INT(6) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, 
    user_id INT(6),
    work_date DATE NOT NULL,
    time1 TIME,
    time2 TIME,
    time3 TIME,
    time4 TIME,
    worked_time INT,

    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
    CONSTRAINT cons_user_day UNIQUE (user_id, work_date)
);

-- Essa senha criptografada corresponde ao valor "a"
INSERT INTO users (id, name, password, email, start_date, end_date, is_admin)
VALUES (1, 'Admin', '$2y$10$/vC1UKrEJQUZLN2iM3U9re/4DQP74sXCOVXlYXe/j9zuv1/MHD4o.', 'admin@cod3r.com.br', '2000-1-1', null, 1);

```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```
